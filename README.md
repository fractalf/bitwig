Stuff I make for my personal use in Bitwig

## Ableton Ping Pong Delay (The Grid)

I missed this from Ableton, so I studied the audio going through (together with Valhalla's ping pong, which use similar algorithm) and made it in The Grid

Preset file: [Ping Pong Delay.bwpreset](https://github.com/fractalf/bitwig/raw/main/Ping%20Pong%20Delay.bwpreset)

## Ableton Auto Filter (Stereo Split)

I missed this from Ableton, so I made it using the Stereo Split and a Filter

Preset file: [Stereo LFO Filter.bwpreset](https://github.com/fractalf/bitwig/raw/main/Stereo%20LFO%20Filter.bwpreset)
