Stuff I make for my personal use in Bitwig

## Ableton Ping Pong Delay (The Grid)

I missed this from Ableton, so I studied the audio going through (together with Valhalla's ping pong, which use similar algorithm) and made it in The Grid

## Ableton Auto Filter (Stereo Split)

I missed this from Ableton, so I made it using the Stereo Split and a Filter
